# Revive

Revive brings back the coding agent a Herdr terminal lost to a reboot or a herdr-core
restart, in the same pane, with the same session and flags. It also forks the focused
agent's conversation into a new session beside it. Agents: Claude Code, Codex, pi,
oh-my-pi (`omp`), Factory Droid (`droid`), the Cursor CLI (`cursor-agent`) and GitHub
Copilot CLI (`copilot`); Droid, Cursor and Copilot CLI are not tested end to end with a
real reboot yet.

## Installing it (for the agent doing it)

1. Read every file in this repository before copying anything.
2. Copy `mods/revive` to `~/.config/herdr-app/mods/revive`.
3. Run `herdr-app check ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/revive`. It must pass.
4. Merge `keys.json` into `~/.config/herdr-app/keys.json`. Ask the person first if
   `cmd-shift-r` is already bound.
5. Tell the person what `install` changes and ask before running it:
   `node ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/revive/revive.mjs install`. It edits
   `~/.claude/settings.json` (only if `~/.claude` exists), `~/.codex/hooks.json` (only if `~/.codex` exists), Droid's
   `~/.factory/hooks.json` if it exists, else `~/.factory/settings.json` (only if
   `~/.factory` exists and the `droid` CLI is on `PATH` or in `~/.local/bin`),
   `~/.cursor/hooks.json` (only if `cursor-agent` is on `PATH`, in `~/.local/bin`, or
   `~/.local/share/cursor-agent` exists; `~/.cursor` alone is the editor's), creates
   `~/.copilot/hooks/herdr-revive.json` (only if `~/.copilot` or `COPILOT_HOME` exists and
   `copilot` is on `PATH`, in `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`), links
   `~/.pi/agent/extensions/herdr-revive.ts` to `mods/revive/pi/revive.ts` (only if
   `~/.pi/agent` exists), links `~/.omp/agent/extensions/herdr-revive.ts` to
   `mods/revive/omp/revive.ts` (only if `~/.omp/agent` exists) and the file their shell
   reads (`~/.zshrc`; for bash on macOS the first existing of `~/.bash_profile`,
   `~/.bash_login`, `~/.profile`, on Linux `~/.bashrc`), keeping the original of each as
   `.revive-backup`. Only one bash file keeps the block: an older one in another of them
   (a Linux login file, from an earlier version) is taken out. If they use both zsh and bash, add
   `--zsh --bash`; `--no-codex`, `--no-pi`, `--no-omp`, `--no-droid`, `--no-cursor`, `--no-copilot` skip
   an agent. pi loads its extension the next time it starts or at `/reload`, omp only
   the next time it starts.
6. Run `node ~/.config/herdr-app/mods/revive/revive.mjs doctor` and report what it shows.
7. New sessions are remembered from now on. Sessions already running are not; they come
   back by themselves only after they are restarted once.

## What you see

- **Dialog** (`mod.open:revive`, 620px wide, as tall as its content, on `popover`, 20px
  padding at the sides, 18px above and 16px below). The sessions scroll once the dialog
  would pass 85% of the window; the header, the note and the footer always show.
  - A header: **↻ Revive** (16px semibold) and *Agent sessions, remembered on their
    terminals* in `dim`.
  - Sections titled in 10.5px medium `dim` capitals:
    - **FOCUSED TERMINAL**: a `raised` card with a `border`, 12px radius, 14px padding. The
      agent's name (14px semibold), the first 8 characters of the session id in JetBrains
      Mono `dim`, and a state on the right: a 6px dot and a word in the state's color
      (*Running* in `ansi2`, *Lost to a restart* and *Interrupted* in `ansi3`, *Resume
      failed* in `ansi1`). Under it the folder in `muted`, with the home folder as `~`, the
      carried flags in 10.5px mono `dim`, and for a session started before Revive was
      installed, a note that it can be forked but won't come back by itself. Buttons: for a
      running agent, **Fork right** `F`, **Fork below** `D` and **Fork to a tab** `T`
      (outline); for one that needs you, a solid **Resume** `↵`. For a running agent that
      can't fork (Cursor): no fork buttons, and *Cursor can't fork a session.* in `dim`. A
      Claude Code session
      with no transcript yet can't be forked: the Fork buttons are disabled, F/D/T do
      nothing, and the card says *This session has no message yet, so there is nothing to
      fork. Send it one first.* A session that ran with something Revive doesn't carry
      (see *Config folders*) can't be forked from the dialog either: *It ran with
      CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR: fork it from its own shell.* Neither can one whose folder failed
      the check: *Its folder is missing, not yours, or writable by others.* An agent running in the terminal with nothing on record
      gets the same card without an id or buttons: its name, *Running*, its folder, and a
      `dim` note that Revive has no record of it, so it can't be forked or brought back.
      For Codex the note adds that Codex records a session at its first message, and not
      at all while its shared background server runs it (`daemon_auto_start`). Without an
      agent: *No agent session in the focused terminal.* On another machine:
      a note that Revive works on this computer for now.
    - **NEED YOU**: other terminals whose session is lost, interrupted or failed. Each row
      (48px, 10px radius, filled with `raised`, `hover` on hover, 4px apart) shows the
      agent (13px medium), the short id, *space / tab* and *resumed 3m ago* in `dim`, the
      state, an **Auto** / **Auto off** ghost toggle and a solid **Resume**. Clicking the
      row closes the dialog and focuses that terminal.
    - **OTHER SESSIONS**: the remaining ones, same rows without the fill or **Resume**. Sessions found
      through their pid but not remembered say *not remembered* instead of the toggle.
  - A note line for errors (`ansi1`) or install output (`muted`), on `raised`.
  - A footer above a `border` line: `✓ Claude Code hooks`, `✓ Codex hooks`, `✓ pi extension`,
    `✓ omp extension`, `✓ Droid hooks`, `✓ Cursor hooks` (each only when that agent is installed), `✓ shell`,
    each `muted` with a `ansi2` ✓ when installed and `ansi1` with `✕` when not, and a solid
    **Install** button while anything is missing.
- The list refreshes every 4 seconds while the dialog is open.
- In a resumed pane, before the agent starts: `↻ Revive: resuming Claude Code session
  9e458eb4. REVIVE_AUTO=0 skips this.` in dim text. When flags that lift approvals or the
  sandbox were left out: `↻ Revive: resuming Claude Code session 9e458eb4 without
  --dangerously-skip-permissions (quit and resume it from the Revive dialog to keep it).
  REVIVE_AUTO=0 skips this.`

## The files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `mods/revive/main.js` | The dialog |
| `mods/revive/lib/core.js` | Agents (the `AGENTS` table), flags, hook payloads, labels, states and the resume script: plain functions shared by the dialog and the engine |
| `mods/revive/lib/sessions.js` | Engine only: finding a running agent's session from the files it writes, for one nobody recorded |
| `mods/revive/revive.mjs` | The engine, run with the person's Node: hooks, the shell check, list, resume, install |
| `mods/revive/lib/extension.js` | Extensions only: what pi's and omp's extensions share (running `revive.mjs hook` one at a time, the SIGTERM/SIGHUP listener) |
| `mods/revive/pi/revive.ts` | pi's extension: runs `revive.mjs hook` at pi's session start and end, with Claude Code's payload |
| `mods/revive/omp/revive.ts` | omp's extension: the same for omp, which has its own extension folder and events |
| `mods/revive/package.json` | Marks the folder as ES modules for Node |
| `mods/revive/mod.json` | Opens as a dialog; docks nowhere |

## The record

A session is remembered as labels on its herdr-core terminal:

| Label | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `revive.agent` | `claude`, `codex`, `pi`, `omp`, `droid`, `cursor` or `copilot` |
| `revive.session` | The session id |
| `revive.cwd` | The folder the session ran in |
| `revive.flags` | The carried launch flags, as a JSON array |
| `revive.needs` | What the session ran with that Revive doesn't carry, as a JSON array of names, never values: the agent's config-folder variables that were set (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`) and `--session-dir` (pi, omp); absent otherwise |
| `revive.transcript` | pi and omp only: the session file the agent named |
| `revive.shell` | The pid of the terminal's program when the session started or was resumed |
| `revive.since` | That program's start time (`ps -o lstart`), so a new shell that got an old pid after a reboot is still new |
| `revive.at` | When it was recorded (ms) |
| `revive.resumed` | When Revive last resumed it (ms); kept until a new session starts |
| `revive.failed` | When a resume gave up within 15 seconds (ms) |
| `revive.auto` | `off` turns automatic resume off for this terminal; kept across sessions |

Labels are kept by herdr-core across its restarts and go away with the terminal.

Anything that can talk to herdr-core can write them, so what is read back is checked
again: the flags go through the agent's carry list, as on the way in; `revive.needs` keeps
only names the agent declares; the folder must pass the check under *Rules*. Records from
0.4.0 are read the same way: their `revive.env` (names and values) counts only by its
names, as needs, and a `--session-dir` in their `revive.flags` counts as a need too.

## Agents

One entry each in `AGENTS` (`lib/core.js`), one hook target in `HOOK_TARGETS`
(`revive.mjs`; pi and omp: an extension in `EXTENSIONS`), and optionally a finder in `lib/sessions.js`: that is all an agent needs.

| Agent | Known by | Resume | Fork | Hooks installed into | Session id from | Carried flags |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `claude`; report `claude-code` | `claude … --resume <id>` | `claude … --resume <id> --fork-session` | `~/.claude/settings.json` | `session_id` | `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--permission-mode`, `--model`, `--agent` |
| Codex | `codex`; report `codex` | `codex resume … <id>` | `codex fork … <id>` | `~/.codex/hooks.json`, groups with `"matcher": ""` | `session_id` | `--no-daemon`, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `--yolo`, `--full-auto`, `--approve-for-me`, `--search`, `-m`/`--model`, `-s`/`--sandbox`, `-a`/`--ask-for-approval`, `-p`/`--profile` (a profile name only, not a path) |
| pi | `pi` as the first word only (pi renames its process `pi`); report `pi` | `pi … --session <id>` | `pi … --fork <id>` | extension linked into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/` (`$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/extensions/`) | `session_id` from the extension | `--provider`, `--model`, `--models`, `--thinking`, `-t`/`--tools`, `-xt`/`--exclude-tools`, `-nt`/`--no-tools`, `-nbt`/`--no-builtin-tools`, `-ne`/`--no-extensions`, `--no-mcp`, `-ns`/`--no-skills`, `-nc`/`--no-context-files`, `-a`/`--approve`, `-na`/`--no-approve`, `--offline` |
| omp | `omp` as the first word only (omp renames its process `omp`); report `omp`, `oh-my-pi` | `omp … --resume <id>` | `omp … --fork <id>` | extension linked into `~/.omp/agent/extensions/` (always that folder: a `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is taken to be pi's) | `session_id` from the extension | `--model`, `--smol`, `--slow`, `--plan`, `--provider`, `--models`, `--thinking`, `--service-tier`, `--tools`, `--skills`, `--no-tools`, `--no-lsp`, `--no-pty`, `--no-extensions`, `--no-skills`, `--no-rules`, `--no-context-files`, `--no-title`, `--hide-thinking`, `--profile` (a name only), `--approval-mode`, `--auto-approve`, `--plan-yolo` |
| Droid | `droid`; report `droid` | `droid … --resume <id>` | `droid … --fork <id>` | `~/.factory/hooks.json` (event map, no `hooks` wrapper) if it exists, else `hooks` in `~/.factory/settings.json`; command `… hook --agent droid` | `session_id` | `--auto`, `--use-spec`, `--disable-builtin-skills` (interactive flags only: `--skip-permissions-unsafe`, `-m` and the reasoning/tool flags are `droid exec` only, and interactive droid reads them as the prompt) |
| Cursor | `cursor-agent`, or `agent`/`node`/`index.js` under a `cursor` or `cursor-agent` folder; report `cursor`, `cursor-agent` | `cursor-agent … --resume <id>` | none | `~/.cursor/hooks.json`: `{"version": 1, "hooks": {"sessionStart": [{"command": …}], "sessionEnd": […]}}`, no timeout; command `… hook --agent cursor` | `conversation_id`; folder from `workspace_roots[0]` | `-f`/`--force`, `--yolo`, `--model` (it has no `-m`), `--sandbox`, `--mode`, `--plan` |
| Copilot CLI | `copilot` as the first word, or the second after `node`/`bun`/`deno` (never `gh copilot`); report `copilot` | `copilot … --resume <id>` | none (`/fork` inside only) | its own file `~/.copilot/hooks/herdr-revive.json` (`$COPILOT_HOME/hooks/`): `{"version": 1, "hooks": {"SessionStart": [{"type": "command", "bash": …, "timeoutSec": 10}], "SessionEnd": […]}}`, deleted whole on uninstall; command `… hook --agent copilot` | `session_id` | `--model`, `--mode`, `--plan`, `--autopilot`, `--reasoning-effort`, `--max-autopilot-continues`, `--agent` (a name only), `--allow-all`/`--yolo`, `--allow-all-tools`, `--allow-all-paths`, `--allow-all-urls`, `--allow-tool`, `--deny-tool`, `--allow-url`, `--deny-url`, `--available-tools`, `--excluded-tools`, `--no-ask-user`, `--experimental`, `--no-experimental`, `--disable-builtin-mcps`, `--disable-mcp-server`, `--no-custom-instructions`, `--disallow-temp-dir`, `--screen-reader`, `--plain-diff`, `--no-mouse` |

Everything else on the command line is left behind: a first prompt, `--resume` itself,
a secret (`--api-key`, Cursor's `-H`). A value flag whose value is missing, looks like
another flag or isn't accepted (a profile that is not a plain name) is dropped with its
value.

### Never carried, and why

The flags travel through a terminal label, which anything that can talk to herdr-core
can write, and they come back unattended after a reboot.

- Permission and sandbox modes are carried, but the ones that lift approvals or the
  sandbox only into a resume the person starts from the dialog. An automatic resume
  leaves them out and its dim line names them. A label writer may be an agent running
  under restricted permissions (a prompt-injected one, say): a bypass it writes into a
  label must not come back unrestricted after a reboot, with nobody watching it start.
  Left out of an automatic resume (each agent's `unattended` in `lib/core.js`):
  - Claude Code: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`,
    `--permission-mode` other than `default`, `manual`, `plan` or `dontAsk`
  - Codex: `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`, `--yolo`, `--approve-for-me`,
    `-a`/`--ask-for-approval never`, `-s`/`--sandbox danger-full-access`
  - Cursor: `-f`/`--force`, `--yolo`, `--sandbox` other than `enabled`
  - omp: `--auto-approve`, `--plan-yolo`, `--approval-mode` (any value)
  - Droid: `--auto`
  - pi: `-a`/`--approve`
- Value flags that pick something by name take a plain name only, never a path: Codex's
  and omp's `--profile`, Claude Code's `--agent` (an agent definition, `plugin:name`
  allowed), omp's `--skills` (comma-separated names).
- Never carried: flags that make the agent load something it would not load otherwise,
  because that runs code or instructions at once on resume: settings, hooks, extensions,
  plugins or MCP servers (`--settings`, `--mcp-config`, `--plugin-dir`,
  `-e`/`--extension`, `--hook`, `--config`, `--approve-mcps`, Codex's
  `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`), extra instructions (`--system-prompt`,
  `--append-system-prompt`, `--append-system-prompt-file`, `--skill`) and extra folders
  (`--add-dir`, omp's `--allow-home`, Cursor's `--workspace`: Cursor loads that folder's
  rules, MCP config and hooks, and the resume already runs in the recorded folder).
- The agent's config-folder variables and `--session-dir` name the folder it loads its
  settings, hooks, extensions or sessions from. Their values are never taken from a
  label: a label could name any folder, and a check of that folder proves nothing, since
  whoever writes labels can also put a matching file there. Only their names are
  recorded (`revive.needs`; see *Config folders* under *Rules*).

A session started with one of these comes back without it; the person adds it again if
they want it.

A running agent nobody recorded is found from its files: Claude Code by
`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`; Droid by the newest `<id>.jsonl` in
`~/.factory/sessions/<cwd, every non-alphanumeric a dash>/` written since the agent started;
Cursor by the newest `<id>/` (folder or its `store.db`) in `~/.cursor/chats/<md5 of the
cwd>/` written since then; Copilot CLI by the `~/.copilot/session-state/<id>/` that holds
`inuse.<its pid>.lock`. Codex, pi and omp: not found.

Checked by hand with droid 1.1.0 and cursor-agent 2026.10.22 on macOS: Droid reports
`droid` to Herdr; its SessionStart hook records the session and its flags; `droid --auto
high --resume <id>` reopens the same session id in high autonomy; `droid --fork <id>` opens
an interactive copy under a new id. Cursor's `sessionStart` fires for a new chat with a
`conversation_id` that `cursor-agent --force --resume <id>` reopens with its history;
it does not fire again when a chat is resumed, so the record a resume leaves on the
terminal carries it to the next restart. Both session-file layouts above match. Not
checked yet: Cursor's `sessionEnd` reasons for `/exit`, Ctrl+C and a shutdown, and a real
reboot with either agent.

Checked by hand with copilot 1.0.109 on macOS: Copilot reports `copilot` to Herdr; hooks
in `~/.copilot/hooks/*.json` run with the `copilot` process as their parent; `SessionStart`
fires at a session's first message (`source: "new"`) and again on `--resume`
(`source: "resume"`), with `session_id` and `cwd`; `copilot --resume <id>` reopens it, and
an unknown id exits 1 at once. `SessionEnd` sends `complete` for a `-p` run and
`user_exit` for `/exit`, Ctrl+C, `/clear`, SIGTERM and SIGHUP alike. `user_exit` is
therefore settled (`end` returns `"settle"`). Copilot exits right after the hook and
takes it down, so the hook starts `revive.mjs settle <terminal> <session> <shell pid>` in a
session of its own and returns. After `REVIVE_SETTLE_MS` (1500), the session
is forgotten only if herdr-core is up, the terminal is live with the same program pid,
that process is alive, and the record still names the session; any doubt keeps it.
`abort`, `error` and `timeout` keep it.

## Rules

- A hook acts only for the agent in its terminal's foreground: walking up from the hook's
  process must reach the foreground pid, and the agent processes on the way (`claude`, or
  `codex` as the first or second word) must be next to each other. An agent and its
  wrapper are one agent (npm's `node …/bin/codex` running the native `codex`, a launcher
  with another name). Agent, shell, agent is a tool call: a `claude -p` an agent runs
  inherits `HC_TERMINAL_ID`, but its hooks record nothing.
- A one-shot run in the foreground (`claude -p`/`--print`, `codex exec`/`e`, `pi -p`,
  `pi --mode json|rpc`, `pi --no-session`, `omp -p`/`--print`, `omp --mode json|rpc|rpc-ui`,
  `omp --no-session`, `omp --export…`, `droid exec`, `cursor-agent -p`/`--print`,
  `copilot -p`/`--prompt`/`--acp`/`--connect` and its subcommands such as `copilot login`)
  records nothing: it fires `SessionStart` and
  ends with reason `other`, so it would replace the interactive session on record and be
  resumed after the next restart.
- pi's extension acts only when `HC_TERMINAL_ID` is set, in pi's `tui` mode, for a session
  with a file. It sends `SessionStart` at every `session_start` (startup, `/new`,
  `/resume`, `/fork`, reload), with pi's command line as `argv` (pi renames its process
  `pi`). At `session_shutdown` it sends `SessionEnd` with reason `prompt_input_exit` only
  for `quit` without a SIGTERM or SIGHUP; a signal, or a session replaced in the same
  process, sends nothing, which keeps the record like Claude Code's `other`. It imports
  `../lib/extension.js` from its own real path, which finds the engine as
  `../revive.mjs` from there, so the extension must be linked, not copied away from the
  mod. It listens for SIGTERM and SIGHUP from its first `session_start` to the
  `session_shutdown`, once however often a session starts. The hook gives up after 10
  seconds, and a hook that fails or can't start `node` is dropped without holding up the
  next one.
- omp's extension (checked against omp 18.16.0) works like pi's, through the same
  `lib/extension.js`, and runs `revive.mjs hook --agent omp`. It differs in two ways.
  omp's `session_shutdown` carries no reason: the extension listens for SIGTERM and
  SIGHUP itself and sends `SessionEnd` with reason `prompt_input_exit` only when neither
  came first (a person's `/exit`, Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D); a reboot, a core restart or a
  closed terminal sends nothing and keeps the record. `/new`, `/resume` and `/fork`
  switch sessions in the same process and report `session_switch`, which is sent as a
  `SessionStart`. omp loads extensions only when it starts, not at a reload.
- Config folders: the hook records the names, never the values, of the agent's
  config-folder variables set in its environment (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`,
  pi's `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR`, omp's
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`), and `--session-dir` when pi or omp ran with it, as
  `revive.needs`. Resume and fork run the agent with the shell's own environment and no
  variables of their own; the transcript check looks only in this process's folder. A
  session with needs resumes by itself only when the resuming shell sets each variable
  on its own, and never when it ran with `--session-dir`.
- The folder a record names is used only as the person's own: `cd` goes to its real
  path (links resolved), and only when it is an existing folder that belongs to this
  user and that others can't write to. Otherwise the record's folder is refused.
- The agent is known by the command line the hook sent (pi, omp), then the foreground command
  line, then the agent process the hook came from, then the hook's `--agent`, then the
  payload (its transcript path, Cursor's `cursor_version`), and only then the terminal's
  last OSC report, which may still be a previous agent's. A bare `agent` on a command
  line is no agent: Cursor's only under a path that says Cursor, or by its report. A running agent
  behind a wrapper is recognized by its report while something other than the shell is
  in the foreground.
- `SessionStart` for the remembered session id (a resume, a compaction) keeps its
  `resumed` mark and `at`; a new session id starts without.
- `SessionEnd` with a session id other than the remembered one is ignored.
- `SessionEnd` with reason `clear` or `resume` does nothing: the same process starts
  another session right away and its `SessionStart` records it; clearing could race it.
- `SessionEnd` with reason `other` (a signal) leaves the record. Any other reason
  (`prompt_input_exit` for `/exit` and Ctrl+C, `logout`, …) forgets it. Codex and Droid
  follow these. Cursor: `completed` and `user_close` forget it, any other reason keeps it.
- Hook payloads are read the same for every agent: the event with its first letter
  capitalized (Cursor's `sessionStart`), the id from `session_id` or else
  `conversation_id`, the folder from `cwd` or else `workspace_roots[0]`.
- The shell block asks `${REVIVE_HC:-hc}` for the terminal and starts node only when its
  answer has a `revive.session` label and the shell's parent is not a shell that ran the
  block (`REVIVE_SHELL`, which the block exports as its `$$`). A shell started by hand
  inside the terminal's costs one `hc get`.
- `check` resumes only when all hold: it runs in the terminal's own shell (`$$` is the
  terminal's pid, or the walk up from `$$` reaches it without passing another shell or
  `REVIVE_SHELL`: the child of a pty wrapper such as Kiro CLI's), the terminal's program is not the remembered one (another pid, or the
  same pid with another start time), automatic resume is on, the agent and the id are
  valid, the last resume did not fail (`revive.failed` is unset), the folder passed its
  check, every need is met (each variable set in the shell, never `--session-dir`), and
  (for Claude Code, pi and omp) the session's transcript exists. Without a transcript the
  record is dropped. A failed resume is not retried at every restart; **Resume** in the
  dialog still tries it.
- When only the folder or an unmet need stops it, `check` says so once, in dim text
  (`↻ Revive: not resuming Claude Code session 9e458eb4: it was started with
  CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. Resume it by hand (Revive dialog).`), and marks the terminal
  `revive.failed`, so the next shell stays quiet.
- **Resume** in the dialog refuses a record whose folder failed the check, and names the
  folder (*Won't resume: its folder ~/w is missing, not yours, or writable by others.*).
  It refuses a record with needs too, keeps the record, and names them with the command
  to copy (*Won't resume here: it ran with CODEX_HOME, which Revive doesn't carry. Set it
  and run: cd -- … && codex resume <id>*). Nothing is typed into the terminal in either
  case. Fork is disabled for both, and so is the dialog's Resume button: the card shows
  the same reason before a click, and for needs the command with a **Copy command**
  button. `unresumable(rec)` in `lib/core.js` is the one test both use.
- `list` checks the transcript only for the focused terminal's running session, the one
  whose card offers Fork. pi's and omp's is the recorded session file. For Claude Code it
  says `forkable: false` only when it is sure: the agent's `sessions/<pid>.json` is in
  this process's folder. Otherwise it says `null` and the fork is let through, since an
  agent started with a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` the app doesn't have keeps its transcripts
  elsewhere. A folder or variable named in a label is never taken as proof.
- `check` marks the terminal (`shell`, `since`, `resumed`) before printing, so a second
  shell can't resume the same session again.
- The shell block runs what `check` printed at the first prompt (zsh: a one-time `precmd`
  hook; bash: `PROMPT_COMMAND`), not while the rc files run. The resume runs with its
  input and output on the terminal's own device (`/dev/$(ps -o tty= -p $$)`), never
  `/dev/tty`: Claude Code's runtime crashes on macOS when its input is that alias.
- The shell block leaves `$?` at 0.
- Session ids must match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:-]{0,127}`; anything else is refused.
  Every word of a command is shell-quoted.
- **Resume** in the dialog sends the command to the terminal with `hc send`, only when its
  foreground is the terminal's own shell, never into another running program.
- Fork opens `terminal.open {argv, folder, place}` with the agent's fork command:
  `claude … --resume <id> --fork-session`, `codex fork … <id>`, `pi … --fork <id>`,
  `omp … --fork <id>`, `droid … --fork <id>`. An agent with no fork (Cursor, Copilot CLI) gets no fork buttons or keys.
- pi's and omp's transcript check is the recorded session file: it exists, or the session never got
  a message. A record without one is let through.
- Install writes an agent's hooks only into the file it reads now, and takes Revive's
  out of every other file it may be in (Droid's `settings.json` once a `hooks.json`
  exists). The shell block works the same way: one file per shell, and a bash block an
  older install left in another bash file (`.bash_profile`, `.bash_login`, `.profile`,
  `.bashrc`) is taken out when bash's is written. A file without Revive in it is never
  rewritten by install or uninstall.
- Hooks never fail an agent: every error is swallowed and the exit code is 0.

## Settings

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `REVIVE_AUTO=0` | Shells with it set never resume automatically |
| `REVIVE_DEBUG=1` | The shell block says why it did or didn't resume, on stderr |
| `REVIVE_HC` | The `hc` binary the engine and the shell block use (default: `hc` on PATH) |
| `REVIVE_TTY` | The device the resume runs on, instead of the terminal's (for tests) |
| `REVIVE_SETTLE_MS` | How long Copilot CLI's `user_exit` waits before checking whether the terminal outlived it (default 1500) |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME`, `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, `ZDOTDIR` | Honored when finding the files to install into; a session's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`CODEX_HOME`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`/`PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` is recorded by name only, as a need. Without `ZDOTDIR` in the environment, `zsh -c` is asked for it (it reads `~/.zshenv`). omp, Droid and Cursor: always `~/.omp/agent`, `~/.factory` and `~/.cursor`. Copilot CLI: `COPILOT_HOME`, else `~/.copilot`; a session's own `COPILOT_HOME` is a need |

Install writes through symlinks to the file they point at, keeps each file's permissions,
and copies the original to `<file>.revive-backup` only the first time. A settings file
whose Revive hooks are already right (the same command and timeout) is not written, even
when another tool reformatted it or added its own groups after Revive's: other tools (Herdr's
own Codex integration among them) rewrite `~/.codex/hooks.json` too. Each hook has a
10 second timeout, except Codex's `SessionEnd`, which gets 3: Codex clamps it to 3 and
warns at every start about anything longer.
